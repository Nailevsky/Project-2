As a construction worker, It would be nice to have an app that serves as a digital toolbox, allowing me to create, access, and customize multiple lists of tools specific to jobs like painting, framing, or carpentry. The app should let me effortlessly add or remove tools, mark them as acquired, and track my inventory in real-time, ensuring I'm prepared for any project without the hassle of manual checklists. This tool would streamline my workflow, prevent tool misplacement, and support efficient job management, directly from my phone or computer.

## MVP Goals (How your specific project will look & behave in order to accomplish MVP)
An MVP for a job-specific tool list management app will enable users to create categorized tool lists, update tool quantities and statuses, and manage tool list details, with a simple and intuitive interface for all CRUD operations. The backend will leverage a RESTful API for data handling, while the frontend will provide a responsive design for accessibility on various devices.

## Stretch Goals (How your specific project look & behave *AFTER* you accomplish MVP)
Add functionality to make a "for sale list" with leftover materials, evaluate them using API or make a bot to sell them.
